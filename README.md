angular-with-django
===================

Sample django project which uses AngularJS. This is an effort to learn AngularJS.

We will update this project with our learnings.

Right now this project uses MySQL as backend database.

In this project we have used static files and JSON data files from the tutorial on http://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial website.
